            If any provision of these Terms is held to be unenforceable or
            invalid, such provision will be changed and interpreted to
            accomplish the objectives of such provision to the greatest extent
            possible under applicable law and the remaining provisions will
            continue in full force and effect.

            Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to
            require performance of an obligation under these Terms shall not
            effect a party's ability to exercise such right or require such
            performance at any time thereafter nor shall the waiver of a breach
            constitute a waiver of any subsequent breach.
